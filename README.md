### 👨‍💻 I call myself  a  🥔 "potato-junior" 🥔 I'm trying to learn and understand the principles of Python programming. And as you can expect, it's a lot of potato level for now but the important thing is to persevere! 👨‍💻


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my solo projects and some duo stuff with my code-partren Jake in our organization named "Hacker-Ninjas"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python from the very basics to more advanced operations to data analytics, which I would like to do one day.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything what push my educating to the next level of my current knowledge.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Linux, deep data code and SQL
- 💬 Ask me about anything what you need but there is 75% chance that I dunno how to answer, 20% lucky and 5% skill. 😄
- 📫 How to reach me: On this e-mail -> santexD@seznam.cz <-
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm downhill skateboarder and PC-master race player.
